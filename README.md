# LANCER Alternative Structure

This module implements [Maria's Alternative Structure](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1unN3HDDeAK3pN1rmgFgZgAXp5flnQ9-KMu-TXt34tnU/edit) rules for Lancer. 

This is a straight replacement for the structure rolling code in the basic system, and should work without the need for additional configuration.

Those rules are used with permission.
